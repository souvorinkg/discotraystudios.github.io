    title: Our Mission
    text: Nonprofit organizations increasingly rely on technology, however, their budgets for technology improvements or new ventures are typically small or nonexistent. Disco Tray Studios at Hendrix College creates software for community partners to support their mission and workflow by providing free prototyping and initial development through utilizing the technology skills of our computer science students. We create interactive websites that help organize and share information and manage complex systems, mobile applications to connect users with resources and information, and educational games to promote empathy and learning.
